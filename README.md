# C#-Calculator
A simple calculator for simple operations in C#. 

## Introduction
I am learning C# & have made a simple calculator to get started. If you want to make your own, feel free to take a look at the code.

## How to use
1. **Install Visual Studio Code:**
   - Download and install VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install .NET SDK:**
   - Download and install the .NET SDK from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet). This includes the runtime and command-line tools required to build and run .NET applications.

3. **Open the project in your terminal**
   - Assuming you have .NET SDK installed, in your terminal you can run:
  ```sh
  dotnet run
  ```

This will run the application. Feel free to edit the "Program.cs" file.
